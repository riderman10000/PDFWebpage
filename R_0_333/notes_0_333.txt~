Hints:
the main Apache server configuration file is in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.  It contains the
configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
hints.

$ apache2 web server
>is a web server used to serve web page requested by client computers
>user enters a Uniform Resource Locator(URL) to point a webserver by means of its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
e.g. FQDN -> www.ubuntu.com
>most common protocol used to transfer web pages is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer(HTTPs), and File Transfer Protocol(FTP), are supported  
>Apache Web Servers are often used in combination with the MySQL database engine, the HyperText Preprocessor (PHP) scripting language, and other popular scripting languages such as Python and Perl. This configuration is termed LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl/Python/PHP) and forms a powerful and robust platform for the development and deployment of Web-based applications.

$ Clients and Servers
A server is a computer that holds content and services such as a website, a media file, or a chat application. The server holds these data and sends it out when requested.

A client is a different computer, such as laptop or cell phone, that request to view, download, or use content. The client can connect over a network to exchange information.

example (easy)
client: radio receiver
server: radio station

$ IP Addresses

-to send and direct data across a network, computers need to be able to identify destinations and origins. This identification is an IP- Internet Protocol-address.
-is a set of four number ranging between 1-255, separated by dots.
example 127.0.0.1

-there are different classifications, or types of IP addresses. A network can be public, or it can be private. Public IP address are accessible anywhere on the internet. Private IP addresses are not, and most are typically hidden a device with a public IP address.

$ Network Hubs and Switches

-Traditionally, computers are connected to each other using cables—creating a network. The cable used most often is Ethernet, which consists of four pairs of wires inside of a plastic jacket. It is physically similar to phone cables, but can transport much more data.
-cables donot make a good network so used a network hub, where all the computer are connected to single hub
-network may slow down using hub if many computer try to send messege at the same time and confuse the hub.
-solutin to the problem is to use switch, which sends the message to the intended destination.
-Switches do have a limitation though—they only know about the addresses of equipment that is plugged directly into them. So, you can only send messages to a small number of devices—however many ports the switch has! If you need to send a message to a computer on another network, it will need to be sent through a router, which we discuss next.

$ Routers and Firewalls

-Routers do the majority of the hard work on a network - they make the decisions about all the messages that travel on the network, and whether to pass messages to and from outside networks.
-there are three main functions:
	a.separate and bridge
		-routers separate networks into sections, or bridge different networks 		together, the private network 192.168.1.71 (or any device in a private network) is bridged to the internet with a public IP address.
	b.Assign IPs
		- they assign IP addresses to device connected to them. In the case of routers, they assign IP address using DHCP- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	c.Firewll and protect
		-They can filter messages or keep users out of private networks. Most routers have a Firewall built in. This is a software function that keeps unwanted messages from reaching the computers on the inside, or private part, of the network.
		
		
$ Wireless Signals
-Wireless signals are electromagnetic waves travelling through the air. These are formed when electric energy travels through a piece of metal -- for example a wire or antenna -- and waves are formed around that piece of metal. These waves can travel some distance depending on the strength of that energy.

$ types of wireless signals
a.frequency
	- wireless signals occupy a spectrum, or wide range, of frequencies: the rate at which a signal vibrates. If the signal vibrates very slowly, it has a low frequency. If the signal vibrates very quickly, it has a high frequency. Frequency is measured in Hertz, which is the count of how quickly a signal changes every second. As an example, FM radio signals vibrate around 100 million times every second! Since communications signals are often very high in frequency, we abbreviate the measurements for the frequencies - millions of vibrations a second is Megahertz (MHz), and billions of vibrations a second is Gigahertz (GHz). One thousand Megahertz is one Gigahertz.
b.modulation
	- wireless signals can be different in the way they convey information. A wireless signal needs to be modulated--or changed--to send information. There are many types of modulation, and different technologies can use one or more types to send and receive information. In the two examples below -- AM and FM radio -- the M stands for modulation. The type of modulation is what makes them different.
	
Wi-Fi signals 

there are two types:
1. 2.4GHz
	- low frequency, common wi-fi tech, signals can become more crowded and interfere with each other
	-can pass through walls and windows fairly well.
2. 5GHz
	-higher frequency, implemented by fewer device, frequencies are less crowded so achieve very fast, cannot pass through wall and windows, have short range.
(read furthur on link no. 3 and 4   )

$ Fire wall
	A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls over all your incoming and outgoing network traffic based on advanced and a defined set of security rules
	-is a program that prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network
	-isolate your computer from the internet using wall of code that inspect each individual packet of data

$ CGI(the Common Gateway Interface)
-a standard way for exchanging  information(includes document contentm type(e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text e.t.c.)): CGI (the Common Gateway Interface, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts).
Webpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as CGI scripts.
-An early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. 
In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an "action" attribute and a button designated as the "submit" button. 
When the submit button is pushed the URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) specified in the "action" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. 
If the "action" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces an HTML page.

$ Virtual Host
-refers to the practice of running more than one website(such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine.
-virtual host can be "IP-based" or "name-based"
-the fact that multiple website are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.
-apache supports both IP & name based Vhosts(virtual hosts).
-the latter variant of virtual hosts is sometime also called host-based or non-ip virtual hosts.


a. Name-based vhosts
- the server relies on the client to report the hostname as part of the HTTP header. In this technique, many different hosts can share the same ip address.
-usually simpler, need only configuration of our DNS server to map each hostname to the correct IP address and then configure apache HTTP server to recognize the different hostnames.

b. IP-based vhosts
-use the ip address of the connection to determine the correct virtual host to serve. therefore need to have separate ip address for each host.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

default configuration of apache varies significantly between various distributionn of linux.
Debian and ubuntu refere to apache as "Apache2" and 
place the configuration files in the /etc/apache2/ directory.
other distro, including Fedora, CentOS and Arch Linux refer to Apache as "httpd" and 
store configuration files in /etc/httpd/ .

To administer basic Apache functionality we can use "init" scripts, which allows us
-- safe and easy way to start, stop and restart the server.
-- allows us to reload the configuration and check the status of the server.

to access these functions, issue the appropriate command

/etc/init.d/apache2 start
/etc/init.d/apache2 stop
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
/etc/init.d/apache2 status

for other distro just change apache2 with httpd.
for some distro the path may be /etc/rc.d/init.d/apache2

additional functionality from CLI to check syntax of apache config. files without needing to restart the server and test ny the command
# apache2ctl -t (for debian and ubuntu)
# httpd -t (for CentOS and Fedora)
these command provide a report on  currently running virtual hosts, containing the port that the host is listening on , the name of the virtual host(i.e. the doamin), the information about the location of the site's configuration settings including file names and line numbers.
-master configuration file for apache is located in the httpd.conf
(in debian located in apache2.conf file)

following command can give list of above file
Note: the order in which these files are included can affect the behavior of the web serve. if later options contradict options set in earlier files, the later options override earlier options. Familiarizing with the existing default configuration can be a helpful learning experience  
grep "Include" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf (debians)
grep "Include" /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
grep "Include" /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
